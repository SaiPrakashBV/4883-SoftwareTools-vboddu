### Overview

The `bst.dot` file represents a binary search tree consisting of seven nodes labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Each node has three fields: "left," "data," and "right." The "data" field contains a numeric value from 1 to 7.

The edges between the nodes show the relationships within the binary search tree. For example, A:left:B indicates that node B is the left child of node A, and A:right:B indicates that node C is the right child of node A.
